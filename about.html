            <p> Backstreet Boys is an American vocal group consisting of Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, and cousins Brian Littrell
                 and Kevin Richardson. 
             The group was formed in 1993 in Orlando, Florida.
             The group rose to fame with their debut international album, Backstreet Boys (1996). 
             In the following year, they released their second international album Backstreet's Back (1997) along with their self-titled U.S. 
             debut album, Backstreet Boys (1997), which continued the group's success worldwide.</p>
             

         <p>They rose to superstardom with their third studio album Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, Black & Blue (2000).
         They also released a greatest hits album, The Hits - Chapter One (2001), with a new single, "Drowning". After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album Never Gone (2005).
